                                You always ask yourself: how do we not get hurt? I guess we cannot. Even if we do nothing, everything ends in hurting. Everything that ends hurt. But always tell yourself: choose the hurting where you will experience joy. The hurting where there are good memories. Not the hurting of what-ifs. Not the hurting because you stopped yourself and did not try anymore. It is better to regret that you did something than to regret that you did nothing at all. <br><br>
                                Dont fret if your heart is as big as the ocean. Someday, someone won't be afraid of how much you love. They won't stay on the shore; <b><i>they'll meet you on the depths</i></b> because you weren't made for shallow waters. So if the time comes, do yourself a favor and learn how to walk away. When a connection starts to fade, learn how to let it go. When a person starts to mistreat you, learn how to move on: to something and someone better. Don't waste your time and energy in forcing something that isn't meant to be. Because the truth is, <b><i>for every one person who doesn't value you, there are tons more waiting to love you better. </i></b>So do better.
                                <br><br>
                                The past few months have been difficult. Doubt would always consume your thoughts, with what-ifs washing away along with time. When there were days that you didn't feel like functioning at all, that you didn't feel like yourself, that you feel like the world is against you, you kept this instilled in your head: <b><i>life is and will always be unfair; but never God.</i></b> He didn't put a desire in your heart that you couldn't fulfill. You always remembered that so you could keep going and keep on believing in the force of your dreams. In the next years, I hope you would always look back with that idea because it will always be a reminder that <b><i>life is too short to be angry at yourself for being human.</i></b>
                                <br><br>
                                This Christmas season, I do not want to wish for your happiness anymore, instead, I wish for you to find meaning in your life. Trust me when I say, with 19 years of living life, that happiness comes and goes: it can be inside you or beside you anytime. Happiness will always be about you, and cannot be dictated by anyone. But imagine, when life treats you good or bad, having meaning gives you something to hold on to. So in the next years, I want to see you grow not because you have achieved greater things in life, but because you found your meaning and you're joyfully living in accordance to it.
