                            <b><i>Time.</i></b> You say that this is always my shortcoming. It has always been my enemy ever since I started college. Being away from home is difficult, but in the end, I will always remember that I chose to be away; not for convenience, but to be away from the comfort of my home. I felt like I have been too comfortable for the past years of my life, and sometimes I have to step out of my comfort zone.<br><br>

                            It has not been hard on your part to let me go, because you already prepared yourself to let me fly a long time ago. You said you can't give me some experiences that I want, so you let me wander on my own- to meet new people, and to see the real world. I have heard my heart beat for places I never thought I'd see with my own eyes.<br><br>

                            Being miles away from you is difficult. But I learned to build a home within myself. That is what one of the things I'm working on right now; I find myself becoming more independent as days pass. Thank you for teaching me that <b><i>I cannot rely on another beating heart for the sake of my own,</i></b>   because I was made to co-exist, not to depend; that I am not anybody else's. I am my own. <br><br>

                            Despite all that we've been through, remember this: there are days when home won't feel like it; but that doesn't mean we leave. It could be filled with a whole lot of pain; but that just means we fix what's broken and clean up the mess to keep home from falling apart. Because, with all these, just as much we need home, there will be days when home will need us to be home too. <br><br> labyu.

                            <br><br><br> Love, Dani<br><br>
